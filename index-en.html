    <h1>Node &amp; React developer</h1>

    <hr />

    <p><abbr title="Too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr></p>
    <p>Adrian Tombu - Full-stack javascript developer (React, Node.js, React Native) - Remote only - <a href="https://0750.typeform.com/to/HbRzus">Contact me !</a></p>

    <hr />

    <p>I welcome you, dear visitor, into this bare but nevertheless interesting page which is a <b>personnal tribute</b> to the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> of my youth.</p>
    <p>Here you won't find any Google Fonts or jQuery. Even less of Node.js, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> or Jekyll. This page is the quintessence of the Internet: an HTML page as we like.</p>
    <p><small>And yes, that website is a troll to all of the templates I have used in my life</small></p>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Adrian Tombu</b>, French-Belgian of profession (with a strong penchant for Abbey brown beer), born developer during the unforgettable year of 1986: <b>Tchernobyl</b> catastrophe, explosion of the <b>Challenger shuttle</b> live in front of millions of viewers, or the passage of the magnificent <b>Halley's Comet</b> (one revolution every 76 years, it's celebration time!). And if you're into great wine, you should know that the 1986 vintage was absolutely exceptionnal.</p>
    <p>Born in Belgium, I moved several times when I finished high school (everything is on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriantombu/">my LinkedIn profile</a> which I use as a centralised CV), before settling up in... <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=puygaillard%20de%20quercy#map=13/44.0327/1.6343">Puygaillard-de-Quercy</a>, in the lost countryside of Occitania, France. This is a small village of 387 living (sort of) people, located about 1h hour from the historic capital of Languedoc: Toulouse!</p>

    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>In my life of <strong>freelance developer in Toulouse</strong>, I mostly work with almost everything related to Javascript (good news for me, it's freaking hot nowadays!):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>React</strong>, his cousin <strong>React Native</strong>, and all the packages around</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js</strong> with Koa, Express, Next</li>
      <li>Aside those barbarian terms, I'm also <a href="https://certificates.opquast.com/certificate/Z865VL/">Opquast Expert in Web Quality</a>. The least we can say is that the internetz do needs some <a href="https://checklists.opquast.com/en/">good practices</a>!</li>
      <li>For all of the other skills that I don't master, you can go and check the <a href="https://greaaat.com/">Greaaat freelance network</a> of which I am a member. It's full of top notch people and you won't regret it!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should know too that I exclusively work on <b>remote mission</b> (as a reminder, I live in the countryside, far away from civilization), even though I'm not savaged enough to refuse poncutal real life (billed) meetings.</p>

    <h2>Let's work together!</h2>
    <p>My <b>availabilities</b> are shown on my <a href="https://twitter.com/adriantombu">Twitter profile</a>, because it's way faster for me than opening a text editor to update the current page.</p>
    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I would absolutely love to work in domains like <b>fintech</b>, <b>crypto</b>, <b>aviation</b> or <b>aerospace</b>. So if you work at <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a>, <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> or even better at the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, by all means, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR TO CONTACT ME?</p>

    <h2>Wanna chat?</h2>
    <p>You can find me through the following links, because phone and mail are so deprecated. Anyway, I don't have cellular network at my work place in the countryside.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>PS: You can also <a href="https://offset.earth/adrian">buy me a tree</a> to give you a good ecological conscience.</p>

    <p>That's all folks! You can now go back to a sane activity...</p>
